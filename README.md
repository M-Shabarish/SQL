# SQL
SQL projects showcasing database design, CRUD operations, advanced queries, and data analysis using relational databases.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to store, manage, and manipulate data in relational databases. It provides commands to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data, as well as to define database structures and control access. SQL is widely used in data analysis, business intelligence, and application development because of its efficiency in handling large datasets.

## Key features of SQL include:

**Data Querying :** Retrieve specific information using SELECT statements with filters, sorting, and grouping.

**Data Manipulation:** Insert, update, or delete records.

**Data Definition:** Create, modify, or delete tables, views, indexes, and schemas.

**Data Control:** Manage user permissions and security.

**Transactions:** Ensure data integrity with COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

SQL is supported by popular databases such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, making it an essential skill for data analysts, developers, and database administrators.
