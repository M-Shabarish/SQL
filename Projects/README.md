# Smart Traffic Light Management
A SQL-based project providing insights into traffic patterns, vehicle counts, congestion hotspots, and signal performance by querying and analyzing real-time traffic datasets. Helps in optimizing traffic flow and improving intersection efficiency.

## Project Highlights
- **Total Records Monitored**: 50
- **Vehicles Tracked Daily**: 14,500
- **Average Waiting Time**: 2.8 minutes per vehicle
- **Peak Traffic Hours**: 8‚Äì10 AM and 5‚Äì7 PM

**Key Findings**
- **Cars** make up the majority of traffic, followed by bikes and buses.
- **Traffic Light** can bee changed the lights according to the sensor count by vehicles , suggesting a need for signal optimization.
- Traffic flow is smoother in the afternoon compared to morning rush hours.
- **violation Vehicles** data indicates Violations type and  underutilized at some intersections.
- vehicles wait times are highest at **busy junctions, highlighting safety and efficiency opportunities**.
